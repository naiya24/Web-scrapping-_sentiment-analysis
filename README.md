# Web-scrapping-_sentiment-analysis

Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive web scraping, data cleaning, and topic classification pipeline for analyzing articles by a specific author. It extracts, cleans, and processes article data, applies sentiment analysis, calculates readability scores, and classifies each article into relevant topics. The final output is saved in a structured Excel file format.
Steps to Run the Scraper and Analysis Pipeline
Prerequisites

    Python: Ensure that Python 3.8+ is installed on your system.
    Chromedriver: Download the appropriate version of ChromeDriver that matches your installed Chrome browser version. Place the executable in a directory in your system PATH or specify the location in the code.

Setup and Execution

    Install Dependencies: Run the following command to install required libraries:

    bash

pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas openpyxl nltk scikit-learn selenium

Download NLTK Data: In the Python script, you’ll need to download specific NLTK datasets for tokenization:

python

import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')

File Structure: Organize your project files as follows:

bash

/project-directory
├── Input.xlsx                # Input file with article URLs and IDs
├── positive-words.txt        # Positive sentiment dictionary
├── negative-words.txt        # Negative sentiment dictionary
├── Stopwords                 # Folder containing stopword text files
├── scraper_script.py         # Main Python script
├── Output_Analysis.xlsx      # Output Excel file for results
└── README.md                 # This README file

Execute the Script: Ensure paths are correctly set, then run the script:

bash

    python scraper_script.py

    This will:
        Scrape article content based on URLs provided in Input.xlsx.
        Perform data cleaning and sentiment analysis.
        Calculate readability metrics and classify topics.
        Save results in Output_Analysis.xlsx.

Dependencies and Required Libraries

    requests: For HTTP requests to fetch web content.
    BeautifulSoup: HTML parsing and data extraction.
    pandas: Data manipulation and saving results to Excel.
    nltk: Natural language processing tasks, such as tokenization and stopwords.
    scikit-learn: Used for building a topic classification model.
    selenium: For automated web scraping, especially handling dynamically loaded content.

How to Retrain the Model or Adjust Topic Classification Rules
Retraining the Model

    Label Data: If using supervised learning, ensure you have a labeled dataset for each topic (e.g., “Technology,” “AI,” etc.).
    Training Pipeline: Modify the script to train on your dataset using TfidfVectorizer and MultinomialNB for topic classification, or update with an unsupervised technique like LDA if manual labels are unavailable.
    Adjust Hyperparameters: Tune parameters for TfidfVectorizer (e.g., max_features, stop_words) or classifier hyperparameters for optimized performance.
    Evaluate and Save Model: Validate classification performance on a test set and save the trained model for future classification tasks.

Adjusting Classification Rules

For rule-based classification, update the keyword lists associated with each topic. These lists can be hardcoded and matched against article content to infer topics based on key terms relevant to each topic.
Known Limitations

    Website Structure Changes: If the target website updates its structure, the scraping selectors (e.g., class_='entry-title') may need modification to match the new HTML layout.
    Dynamic Content Handling: If the website uses JavaScript to load articles or pagination, additional handling with Selenium might be necessary.
    Classification Accuracy: Achieving high accuracy requires a robust, labeled dataset for training the classifier. Unsupervised topic classification, such as LDA, may yield less precise results without adequate fine-tuning.
    Ethical Considerations: Ensure compliance with the website’s Terms of Service, including adhering to rate limits and avoiding extensive server requests in a short time frame.

Conclusion

This pipeline provides a structured and reusable approach to web scraping, sentiment analysis, readability assessment, and topic classification for textual data from articles. For any modifications, refer to the code’s comments and adjust according to specific needs.
